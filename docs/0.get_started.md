# Get Started

Welcome to the **Words Game**! This guide will help you set up everything you need to start playing.

## Installation
1. clone this repo.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/FusionCoders/WordsGame.git
    ```

2. navigate into the project folder.
    ```
    cd WordsGame
    ```

## Compile the Program

To prepare the game for execution, you need to compile the `main.cpp` file located inside the `WordsGame` folder. The instructions vary depending on your operating system:

### For Linux/macOS:
Use the g++ compiler to generate the game executable:
  ```bash
  g++ -o main main.cpp
  ```

### For Windows (MinGW):
Run the following command in the MinGW terminal to compile the program:
  ```
  g++ -o main.exe main.cpp
  ```

This step will create an executable file named `main` (Linux/macOS) or `main.exe` (Windows) in the current directory.

## Run the Game
Once the program is compiled, you can start the game by executing the appropriate command for your operating system:

### On Linux/macOS:
    
  ```
  ./main
  ```

### On Windows:
  ```
  main.exe
  ```

## Select a Board File
When you start the game, you will be prompted to select a board file. You can choose from the options provided in the `WordsGame` folder:

- board.txt
- b002.txt
  
Ensure these files remain in the same directory as the executable to avoid any issues. You can also create your own boards.
